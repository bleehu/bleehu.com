Snarky Moose
Echo 2
Snarky Moose, or just Moose. I have been playing HVZ since I transferred to the UW in Fall 2012. I didn’t know anyone on campus but the game sounded fun so I signed up. Monday morning rolled around and I was unprepared! However I ran into some fellow humans within minutes, one of them was <a href="agent.php?agent=wazowski" title="Wazowski's profile">Wazowski</a>.  I soon met <a href="agent.php?agent=ringtail" title="Ardent Ringtail's profile">Ringtail</a> and <a href="agent.php?agent=buttercup" title="Buttercup's profile">Buttercup</a>. Since that apocalypse we have been running together and growing our Pack.
I helped found ECHO team for the apocalypse of winter 2013… My specialties include (but not limited to): Eating brains solo, sneaking, and the zombie look (IE: makeup and costume). [Commander's note: Agent Snarky Moose was instrumental in directing Operation: Stormfront, the sucessful extermination of the hostile Tahomee Rebels in Maple Valley. She is an inspiration to the troops and a deadly combatant herself.]
