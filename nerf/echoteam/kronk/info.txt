There is little record of this man's accomplishments prior to his short time at the University of Washington, but his reputation from past stories is unbelievably impressive. A living legend in his home country of Bukina Faso, Carter Case set the native standard for excellence by surviving 15 consecutive weeks of HvZ. With nothing but sock grenades, cat-like agility, and a cunning wit, Case has flustered zombies without reservation. Nearly 1300 zombies have fallen by his hand. His team in Burkina, referred to as the Senegalese Rifles in honor of the WWI riflemen company, reportedly has the single largest K-D ratio in HvZ history; rumours abound it reached 100:1 at one point. 
Scholars have argued about the legitimacy of Case's exploits for decades; when approached for comment on the controversy, Case response was blunt. "I let my game speak for me," he leveled. "Words are ephemeral, the vast majority of which fall out of remembrance. Heroes are known not for their words, but their actions. The tactical moves of military leaders make the cut in the historical record; my aim is to follow their lead." It appears Case is well on his way to further HvZ glory; perhaps one day his name will join the likes of <a href="agent.php?agent=wazowski" title="Wazowski's profile">Wazowki</a> and <a href="agent.php?agent=highlander" title="Highlander's profile">Highlander</a> in the history books.
