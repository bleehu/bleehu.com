Elworth
Echo 13
A quiet killer, Elworth is known for his quick sock work and dripping sarcasm. He stands as the only Echo Team member to survive until the final mission.
While his earlier exploits are a story yet to be told, his success during the outbreak of Spring in '13 is nothing short of Echo Team legend. After using his ninja-esque skills and lightning-fast reflexes to makeit to the final mission, Elworth volunteered for the human's suicide squad and gave his life valiantly buying time for three humans to escape. The suicide squad eventually fell to Echo Horde, after which many pictures were taken in the cold and the rain.
