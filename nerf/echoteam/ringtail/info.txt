Ardent Ringtail
Echo 3
Ringtail brings to the battlefield more experience than most squads put together. Before deployment to Seattle, Ringtail saw action on inneurmerable missions against the hoardes in Maple Valley and Ravensdale. She has done multiple tours with both the ICU commandos and the presteigous Crimson Raiders. Though very proficient with heavy weapons, such as the Nerf N-Strike ECS-50 Stampede, Ringtail prefers a more subtle approach, tending to use stealth and agility, often on missions deep behind enemy lines.
