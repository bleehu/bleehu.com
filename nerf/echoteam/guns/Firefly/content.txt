If a single firearm had to represent Echo Team, it would be the Nerf N-Strike REV-8 Firefly. Dependable, accurate, and easy to use, the Firefly has found a special place in many operative's hearts. <a href="agents.php?agent=wazowski">Wazowski </a> has a trusty first-gen Firefly nicknamed "Tychicus" on which he has cut more than fourty headcounts into. Agent <a href="agents.php?agent=buttercup"> Buttercup </a> affectionately refers to hers as "Puablo".The REV-8 draws its designation from its revolving muzzle, a mechanism very similar to that of a Maverick. The number 8 in its designation represents its 8-dart drum, which is front-fed. While virtually any dart can be fired from a REV-8, blunt-tipped sniper or elite darts tend to protrude just a little bit in front of the muzzle and get caught in the suspension arm, causing a jam. Velcro dart-tag darts will cause this effect as well. Fireflies have good medium range, providing accurate, single-round fire at medium distances. Unfortunately they cannot slamfire, though a skilled agent can pump and fire almost as fast.
