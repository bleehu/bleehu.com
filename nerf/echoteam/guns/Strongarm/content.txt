A modern replacement for the popular Maverick, the Nerf Elite Strongarm is perhaps the most sought-after sidearm on the market. Unbeleivably cheap despite its brilliant performance, Strongarms will likley be finding their way into common circulation among deployed elements. Agent <a href="agents.php?agent=moose"> SnarkyMoose </a> was first to recognize its value, using it against a few zombies in Spring of '13. She then lent it <a href="agents.php?agent=muppet"> Muppet </a> who proceeded to set the record of stuns for first-timers on Echo Team that same week. Muppet later bought her own. A Strongarm holds six rounds in a revolving drum that is improved over the classic Maverick. When unchambered, the drum swings out an extra inch and a half, giving much easer access to the individual dart chambers. The chambers themselves have a slight angle on the mouth, making feeding the darts just a hair easier. What really sets the Strongarm apart from its ancestor though, is its extra fifteen feet of power and top-of-the-line slamfire technology. The extra kick accounts for a higher degree of accuracy, making the Strongarm a legitimate contender in  typical medium-range fights. The new slamfire feature lets the weilder simply hold down the trigger, ejecting a dart at 80% speed every time the weapon is pumped. Even the greenest agent can empty the whole drum downrange in less than five seconds.
