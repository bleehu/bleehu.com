The Nerf N-Strike AS-20 Rapid resembles a super soaker as much as a Nerf gun, and fires a little like one as well. It is capable of dumping all 20 of its rounds on a nearby area in less than eight seconds. The AS-20  has a fire-rate selector dial on the side that lets the user switch between "rapid fire" which sends an angry swarm of dars downrange faster than any other nerf system, or "single fire" which simply halves the fire rate. An armed-and-ready AS-20 is a very dominant force in medium to close range. Catching an enemy in range and out of cover is almost always fatal. The down side is that it's muzzle-loading design makes it almost impossible to fully reload in the heat of combat, and older models have to be constantly pumped up. It works well when used with a sidearm. When used by an experienced agent, the rapid can be a very effective tool. Reports suggest that Josh Greer, UWHVZT spokesman, uses one for dangerous missions. Echo Team has one in its armory, but Agent <a href="agent.php?agent=ivy" title="to Poison Ivy's Profile"> Poison Ivy </a> is the only agent so far to use it consistently.
