Besides being embarassingly gramatically inproper, The EX-3 lacks the range and capacity to contend with larger equipment. To its credit, it is small, compact, lightweight, and very cheap.  It has a spring which is coiled by pulling on the ring behind the handle. It also has a small red LED just below the muzzle that is focused by an adjustable plastic lens that suposedly helps aim the gun. The LED turns on when the trigger is half-pulled, but the  gutless LED doesn't even project to the short range of the gun itself. It has some value as a sidearm, rather than a primary weapon, but the newer, more powerful <a href="#strongarm"> Strongarm </a> is much better option.The EX-3 is one of the oldest models that Hasbro designed in the Nerf line. As such, the Nitefinder also has one of the earliest designs of the air restrictor in it, which is the cheif reason for the pitiful range. The good news is that the restrictor can be easily removed, boosting the range from 15 feet to a respectable medium-long range depending on the age of the (spring in the) gun, the dart used, and conditions.
