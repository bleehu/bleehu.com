The Longshot was released alongside the Recon and debuts the elite-style sniper dart, which recently evolved into the new Elite line of weapons. The longshot represents Nerf's first design for a sniper-like gun, and similarly to other early models were designed to be underpowerd for the  saftey of the eight-year-olds that could feasibly use the weapon. Longshots are often sought after for with the intention of modding them, especially since they were discontinued by Hasbro. Though a stock Longshot is perfectly usable as a medium range semi-auto clip-fed rifle. The Longshot is often confused with its younger brother, the <a href="#longstrike"> Longstrike</a>.Many of the armed foces in the area use longshots with various customizations. The ICU heavily favors moddified longshots, with half of its operators using them in combat and almost all operators using clip-fed weapons so that sharing ammo is quick and easy. <a href="agent.php?agent=wazowski"> Agent Wazowski </a> often uses one both against the undead and in firefights. The dangerous Jim Fuchs of the Tahommie Rebel Forces uses a longshot almost exclusively.
