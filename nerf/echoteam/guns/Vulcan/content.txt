The Vulcan is generally considered to be the heaviest weapon on the market, but it's bark is usually worse than its bite. Sporting a 30-round belt and a moderately fast electric motor, a standard Vulcan can keep suppressive fire up for far longer than any other full-auto weapon system. It's range leaves something to be desired, but it's easy to mod for significantly more range.Dispite their price tag, several ECHO Team members use Vulcans and they're even more common among allied teams. In particular Wazowski employs two Vulcans modded by the legendary "Killer," one named "Bertha" and the other named "Bettsy."
