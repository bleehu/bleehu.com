The N-Strike REV-10 Barricade is Hasbro's first released attempt at a semi-automatic electric gun. While effective, the Barricade is a little large, and as long as the gun is charged and ready to fire, it emits a sound much like a hair dryer, which makes stealth operators cringe. Wazowski is currently the only Echo Team member to use Baricades. The two of them  are both moddified by Killer, a tech from the Highlanders clan. They currently are unnamed. The Barricades make an excelent companion to Riot Shileds, or when used together, allow an agent to effectively dual-wield.
