The Roughcut fills a niche between medium weapon and sidearm. It is light, but a little large to conceal, and has good range and semi-auto fire rate. It's also relatively cheap; it usually goes for under $20.
No ECHO Team members currently use the Roughcut. Most of our intel on the weapon comes from facing it in opposition against The Resistance, where it is common among their scout and CQC units.
