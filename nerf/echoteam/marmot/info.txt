Ghost Marmot avoids zombies in the field with stealth and provides real-time action reports to other Echo Team members. Outside of combat, Marmot helps maintain the team website and is currently working on the developement of the automatic action report system, debuting Fall 2013. During the Summer of '13, Ghost Marmot was deployed into a live-fire LZ in Maple Valley, where she joined the fight against the deadly Tahommie Rebles during Operation: Stormfront. Once on-station, she quickly armed herself and rondevouzed with other elements of Echo Team and acted in a fast-reaction cordon-and-strike team. Her efforts where among those that won the mission for the Coalition.
