Muppet 
Echo 8
Spring 2013 is Muppet's first apocalypse, and her combat style has yet to be witnessed. However, her overall strategies consist of extreme caution as a human with planned routes, escape options and building hopping, and as a zombie outsmarting the humans in stealth while waiting in unsuspected hiding spots, as well as outrunning them in short, frantic distances.
