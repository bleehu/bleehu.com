Buttercup 
Echo 4
Buttercup helped found echo team after eating <a href="agent.php?agent=moose" title="Snarky Moose's Profile">Snarky Moose</a> their first quarter on deployment in UW's zombie-infested battlegrounds. Quick-witted, and an adroit zombie, she makes a great addition to the horde.
Buttercup was one of the first deployed into Maple Valley during Operation: Stormfront. She fought fearlessly and relentlessly alongside elements of the Highlanders, (not to be confused with <a href="agent.php?agent=highlander" title="Agent Highlander's Profile"> Agent Highlander</a>). She displayed excelent tactical awareness and rapid maneuvering to maintain containment and flanking positions. Rumors of a high body count are unconfirmed.
