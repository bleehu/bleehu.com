Highlander
Echo 6
Highlander first cut his teeth fighting the Tahoma rebels of Maple Valley under the command of <a href="agent.php?agent=wazowski" title="Wazowski's profile">Wazowski</a> back in '08. From the very begining of his career, his skill in moddifying and outright constructing new and dangerous foam-flinging ordinance has made him a lethal enemy to have, or a prized tactical teammate. </p> <p> Agent Highlander developed a superweapon just in time for Operation Stormfront and deployed it to massive effect. Highlander neutralized many hostiles at extreme range before being wounded in action by a dart to the leg. Before being rushed out of theater by medivac, Echo Team intercepted enemy commuincations warning of the "CO2 Guy." Agent Highlander also deftly commanded elements of the Highlander Strike team, who'se matching names are mostly coincidence.
Highlander also is a good friend. His jovial antics and class-clown demeanor lifts morale, even among the war-torn theaters that Echo Team often finds itself in. His goofyness masks a deeply caring and introspective cabability as well.
