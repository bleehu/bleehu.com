			<h2> FIREFLY </h2>
			<img src="images/guns/firefly.jpg" alt="N-Strike REV-8 Firefly" title="N-Strike REV-8 Firefly"/>
			<p> If a single firearm had to represent Echo Team, it would be the 
				Nerf N-Strike REV-8 Firefly. Dependable, accurate, and easy to use,
				the Firefly has found a special place in many operative's hearts.
				<a href="agents.php?agent=wazowski">Wazowski </a>
				has a trusty first-gen Firefly nicknamed "Tychicus" on which he has
				cut more than fourty headcounts into. Agent
				<a href="agents.php?agent=buttercup"> Buttercup </a>
				affectionately refers to hers as "Puablo". 
				</p>
				<p>The REV-8 draws its designation from its revolving muzzle, a
					mechanism very similar to that of a Maverick. The number 8 in
					its designation represents its 8-dart drum, which is front-fed.
					While virtually any dart can be fired from a REV-8, blunt-tipped
					sniper or elite darts tend to protrude just a little bit in front
					of the muzzle and get caught in the suspension arm, causing a
					jam. Velcro dart-tag darts will cause this effect as well.
					Fireflies have good medium range, providing accurate, single-round
					fire at medium distances. Unfortunately they cannot slamfire,
					though a skilled agent can pump and fire almost as fast.</p>

			<h2> Strongarm </h2>
			<img src="images/guns/strongarm.jpg" alt="Elite Strongarm" title="Elite Strongarm"/>
			<p> A modern replacement for the popular Maverick, the Nerf Elite Strongarm is 
				perhaps the most sought-after sidearm on the market. Unbeleivably
				cheap despite its brilliant performance, Strongarms will likley
				be finding their way into common circulation among deployed elements.
				Agent <a href="agents.php?agent=moose"> SnarkyMoose </a> was first
				to recognize its value, using it against a few zombies in Spring of
				'13. She then lent it <a href="agents.php?agent=muppet"> Muppet </a>
				who proceeded to set the record of stuns for first-timers on Echo
				Team that same week. Muppet later bought her own.
				</p>
				<p>A Strongarm holds six rounds in a revolving drum that is 
					improved over the classic Maverick. When unchambered, the drum
					swings out an extra inch and a half, giving much easer access
					to the individual dart chambers. The chambers themselves have a
					slight angle on the mouth, making feeding the darts just a hair
					easier. What really sets the Strongarm apart from its ancestor
					though, is its extra fifteen feet of power and top-of-the-line
					slamfire technology. The extra kick accounts for a higher degree
					of accuracy, making the Strongarm a legitimate contender in 
					typical medium-range fights. The new slamfire feature lets the
					weilder simply hold down the trigger, ejecting a dart at 80%
					speed every time the weapon is pumped. Even the greenest agent
					can empty the whole drum downrange in less than five seconds.</p>

			<h2> Vulcan </h2>
			<img src="images/guns/vulcan.jpg" alt="N-Strike EBF-25 Vulcan" title="N-Strike EBF-25 Vulcan"/>
			<p> Perhaps the most intimidating nerf weapon on the market, the Nerf N-Strike
				EBF-25 Vulcan is a 25-round belt-fed battery-powerd heavy machinegun. capable
				of a solid minute and a half of fully-automatic fire. The unit pictured
				above is shown with it's belt attatched and the tripod clipped to the bottom.
				</p>
				<p> From <a href="agents.php?agent=wazowski" 
							title="Agent Wazowski's Profile"> Agent Wazowski's </a>
					service with the ICU, Echo Team can employ two unmodified Vulcans,
					named Betsy and Bertha respectively. While effective at eliminating
					large numbers of zeds en masse, the Vulcans are difficult to 
					maneuver with, and leave the weilder vulnerable to supers, making them
					an unpopular choice during most zombie matches. In armed conflict, 
					The vulcans are usually outranged, but tactically draw enemy attention,
					and can be very useful for pinning down or suppressing enemies.</p>

			<h2> Barricade </h2>
			<img src="images/guns/barricade.jpg" alt="N-strike REV-10 Barricade" title="N-Strike REV-10 Barricade"/>
			<p> The N-Strike REV-10 Barricade is Hasbro's first released attempt at a semi-automatic
				electric gun. While effective, the Barricade is a little large, and as long as the
				gun is charged and ready to fire, it emits a sound much like a hair dryer, which
				makes stealth operators cringe. 
				</p>
			<p> 
					Wazowski is currently the only Echo Team member to use Baricades. The two of them 
					are both moddified by Killer, a tech from the Highlanders clan. They currently are
					unnamed. The Barricades make an excelent companion to Riot Shileds, or when used
					together, allow an agent to effectively dual-wield.

			<h2> Rapid </h2>
			<img src="images/guns/rapid.jpg" alt="N-strike AS-20 Rapid" title="N-Strike AS-20 Rapid"/>
			<p> The Nerf N-Strike AS-20 Rapid resembles a super soaker as much as a
				Nerf gun, and fires a little like one as well. It is capable of dumping all
				20 of its rounds on a nearby area in less than eight seconds. The AS-20 
				has a fire-rate selector dial on the side that lets the user switch between
				"rapid fire" which sends an angry swarm of dars downrange faster than any other
				nerf system, or "single fire" which simply halves the fire rate. 
				</p>
			<p> 
					An armed-and-ready AS-20 is a very dominant force in medium to close range.
					Catching an enemy in range and out of cover is almost always fatal. The down
					side is that it's muzzle-loading design makes it almost impossible to fully
					reload in the heat of combat, and older models have to be constantly pumped
					up. It works well when used with a sidearm. When used by an experienced agent,
					the rapid can be a very effective tool. Reports suggest that Josh Greer, UWHVZT
					spokesman, uses one for dangerous missions. Echo Team has one in its armory, but
					Agent <a href="agent.php?agent=ivy" title="to Poison Ivy's Profile"> Poison Ivy
					</a> is the only agent so far to use it consistently.

			<h2> Nite Finder </h2>
			<img src="images/guns/nitefinder.jpg" alt="N-strike EX-3 Nite Finder" 
					title="N-Strike EX-3 Nite Finder"/>
			<p> Besides being embarassingly gramatically inproper, The EX-3 lacks
				the range and capacity to contend with larger equipment. To its
				credit, it is small, compact, lightweight, and very cheap. 
				It has a spring which is coiled by pulling on the ring behind the
				handle. It also has a small red LED just below the muzzle that is
				focused by an adjustable plastic lens that suposedly helps aim the
				gun. The LED turns on when the trigger is half-pulled, but the 
				gutless LED doesn't even project to the short range of the gun itself.
				It has some value as a sidearm, rather than a primary weapon, but the
				newer, more powerful <a href="#strongarm"> Strongarm </a> is much better
				option.
				</p>
			<p> 
					The EX-3 is one of the oldest models that Hasbro designed in the
					Nerf line. As such,
					the Nitefinder also has one of the earliest designs of the air
					restrictor in it, which is the cheif reason for the pitiful range.
					The good news is that the restrictor can be easily removed, boosting
					the range from 15 feet to a respectable medium-long range depending on
					the age of the (spring in the) gun, the dart used, and conditions.

			<h2> Longshot </h2>
			<img src="images/guns/longshot.jpg" alt="N-Strike CS-6 Longshot" 
					title="N-Strike CS-6 Longshot"/>
			<p> The Longshot was released alongside the Recon and debuts the elite-style
				sniper dart, which recently evolved into the new Elite line of weapons.
				The longshot represents Nerf's first design for a sniper-like gun, and
				similarly to other early models were designed to be underpowerd for the 
				saftey of the eight-year-olds that could feasibly use the weapon. Longshots
				are often sought after for with the intention of modding them, especially 
				since they were discontinued by Hasbro. Though a stock Longshot is perfectly
				usable as a medium range semi-auto clip-fed rifle. The Longshot is often
				confused with its younger brother, the <a href="#longstrike"> Longstrike</a>.
				</p>
			<p> 
				Many of the armed foces in the area use longshots with various customizations.
				The ICU heavily favors moddified longshots, with half of its operators using
				them in combat and almost all operators using clip-fed weapons so that sharing
				ammo is quick and easy. <a href="agent.php?agent=wazowski"> Agent Wazowski </a>
				often uses one both against the undead and in firefights. The dangerous Jim Fuchs
				of the Tahommie Rebel Forces uses a longshot almost exclusively.
