bleehu|Use this as a place to discuss where to send which followers. And who should assign which Follower. We are still working on a place to submit suggestions for Contracts and this is not it. Until that is implemented, please post those on Facebook.
bleehu|We are advancing the Month forward. Please Discuss where to send them next! (New contracts will become available before Wednesday)
bleehu|We currently have only 3 contracts for mages but we have 4 Mages to do them. would someone please suggest anothed contract for mages? Also, if nobody has any objections, I suggest we send Kardin to hire new blood.
assailant|Didn't we already do mind dust pt II?
assailant|I sent hess on spy hunter again.
bleehu|we did do Mind dust PII, but it failed. 
assailant|can we send shadow on mind dust again then?  if no one else has any objections. 
tenseboy|yes send shadow
bleehu|Send Shadow on Mind Dust2
bleehu|We should put Dex on &quot;Now You See Me&quot; 'cause he's got the highest research score. Fai and Alex's new character could use the stealth.
assailant|i'll send dex on now u see me.
assailant|there are two balasaars btw.
bleehu|As I recall, only one of the Balasaars are in Tychicus, while the other is in the other world.
assailant|I suggest we send gregory to research now u see me as well, so that the assassins can be stealthier during the missions.
assailant|we should also send another assassin on mind dust ptII, so that there is a better chance of it succeeding.
assailant|Also, we should prolly send a leader to get more people.  if we get more people, we can send those people on more missions and have a potentially higher success rate.
bleehu|Assailant, Do you have an assassin in mind for Mind Dust PII? And for more people, do you mean New Blood?
assailant|u should prolly send mattemeo for mind dust pt 2, but either assassin would work.  For more poeple, I did mean the New Blood mission, provided it has a chance of giving us people that we can assign to missions, and not just to the mines or the stores and whatnot.
masterdiekillsu|Geoff has a natural stealth of 23. Use him for stealth missions. Also, I think the gnome missions are highly important. We should get those done first, with priority. Highest diplomacy to the fey gate. 
masterdiekillsu|Oh, and don't forget to post the player lore. 
bleehu|Let's clear Gregory to do &quot;Now You See Me&quot; and Mattemeo for Mind Dust. But let's let someone with a lower score actually assign them. New blood was intended to accrue Followers, not just mine workers, but since the Contract takes place on Daniel's Domain, he makes that call.
bleehu|Highest Diplomacy is Radifen. Let's send him on a gnome mission. Kardin has the highest inspiration, let's send him on New Blood.
tenseboy|if no one cares im going to send gregory on tick tick
assailant|I thought we decided to send gregory on now u see me stephen?
bleehu|Ya, Stephen, you gotta read at least five comments down or so. We weren't planning on sending Gregory on tick tick. Also, if you're going to ask people if they have any objections, you gotta wait a day or so for people to check the site, read your comment and see if they have objections ;) (We're still new at this, so etiquette is still being figured out, no big deal)
tenseboy|sorry aoubt that you can change it if you want
masterdiekillsu|I'm sending Geoff to work on now you see me. 
masterdiekillsu|Oh. Never mind. 
masterdiekillsu|I'm going to assist on he gnome front. At least Geoff is. 
assailant|There is still one more follower left to assign that is a leader.  Has everyone got to assign two followers?
bleehu|Wildlovlies, Daniel, and &quot;Error&quot; haven't assigned anyone yet and are still below the webpoint reward line.
danandrereed|I sent myself (Marindred) on Once More Unto The Breach.
tenseboy|what do we want kardin to do
wildlovelies|wildlovelies went to gnome gate, kardin sent to hire new blood
error|Rorre is going to work on The Corriolis Effect due to his battle experience and practice with crossbows.
error|I just got informed how this works so slaying a vampire sounds like fun.
assailant|So why does it list Gardonazorph as level 12, when everybody else has a playerness of 1?
masterdiekillsu|So, all we need is Dupree's  and Ashley's character go on a contract. 
tenseboy|had to send ashley because she does not have an account yet she will contact bleehu tonight about getting a user name and password
masterdiekillsu|So when do we get our goodies stats?
assailant|prolly towards the end of the month
bleehu|Goodies from contracts will be delivered at the turn of the month. (VERY shortly). Goodies from adventures should be delivered during the real-world week following the adventure (even shortlier). Both Daniel and I have been a little delayed in getting the respective goodies to our players. For which we apologize. On the other hand, look forward to it raining goodies very soon! =)
assailant|With these goodies, we will take over the world.  muahahahahahaha.
assailant|after the invisibility cloaks are made, can we start research on non-detection cloaks.  And yes, they are different from invisibility cloaks.
bleehu|What is it you want this new cloak to do?
assailant|http://dndtools.eu/classes/occult-slayer/  
assailant|go down a little bit, and you will see the description for the non-detection cloak.
bleehu|Ladies and gentlemen, that is what is called &quot;doing your reading&quot;!!! Just such a contract will be available next month, and your point account will be credited! Thanks for being an active player! Is there anything else we can do for you?
masterdiekillsu|Krivtown needs to be added to the map, as well as several interesting things about it. have fun too, it is Krivtown after all.
tenseboy|can we research the slegde hammer from red faction gurilla
bleehu|T-Boy, I don't know that there's anything particularly special about the sledgehammer from Guerrilla, but you can absolutely research upgrades to your sledgehammer. What did you have in mind? 
bleehu|Killer: please put content requests/bug reports on the Facebook page, this is a place where players can discuss/coordinate follower movements. Krivtown has been added to the Tychicus Country tab, and will be on the map's quick read-out as soon as I can get some down time.
tenseboy|something kind of like a gravity hammer or http://redfaction.wikia.com/wiki/Sledgehammer
danandrereed|A gravity hammer sounds fun, but that might take some serious research to accomplish (unless you get a lucky breakthrough)
masterdiekillsu|The gravity hammer is almost like a serious explosion, but kind of in the form of a shock wave with out electricity. Know what I mean?
assailant|I want my personal character to go on It's called a what?
tenseboy|if no one objects and gives a good reason why I should not I am going to send shadow on hammer time tomorrow
assailant|There's a type in settle the scorched lands in the first sentence: no permanent Tychian establishment exists on Tychicus.
assailant|*typo
masterdiekillsu|There was something I had an idea for about today, but I completely forgot to tell you guys about it. 
bleehu|I think we should send people to settle the scorched lands, but I can't actually make any decisions there, since that's my DM realm. What do you guys think?
