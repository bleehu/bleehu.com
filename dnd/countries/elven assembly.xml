			<description> A newer race of elves, the arc elves are lovers of life.  Arc elves all live every day like it was their last, and are the only known elves that can hold their drink better than dwarves.  They are brilliant craftsmen, and have recently proved themselves to be exemplary blacksmiths as well to supply themselves and their elven brethren with weapons.  Although not as magically gifted as their brethren they are much greater in number.

			<description> Wood elves love nature, and tend to live in the trees.  The best sung wood in the world comes from the elves.  They are masters of all kinds of nature magic, although they are few in number because of reclusive tendencies.
