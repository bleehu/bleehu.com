The mysterious kingdom of Argonis lies just across the previously-bandit-infested planes to the East of Tychicus. In the initial scouting report, little was learned. Except that the kingdom was rather ambivalent to Tychicus and that the average citizen was kept in a daze, likely in connection to a substance called "Mind Dust".

More information after further scouting.

<description> Story update:  You approach the city, the guards wave you in, but give you a strange look.  You wonder why they did that, you’re dressed like a normal merchant.  You even borrowed these clothes from a merchant back in Tychicus.  You walk through the city, but something feels off.  Maybe it’s the way everyone is always smiling, but without any real happiness or joy.  You are surprised by how many people are within the town walls.  You wonder how they are all being fed, with no farmland to speak of anywhere around the city.  They certainly aren’t trading with Tychicus for food.  Suddenly everyone is staring at you, did they see through your disguise?  Soldiers are suddenly everywhere, and you decide it’s time to hit the panic button, as you disappear you see one of the people in the crowd mouth to you, “Join us.”  You reappear in Shadow’s lab, and you realize what was wrong. They had no merchants, no places of business, only houses.  You wonder what that could mean. </description>
