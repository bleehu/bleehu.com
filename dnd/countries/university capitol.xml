		<University> Little is known about the current state of affairs in University.  The city has a rich history and is covered in art and libraries.  It has been a place of learning for centuries.  Some records even claim that it existed before the last Great War.  This may sound implausible, but considering how quickly it became unreachable once war broke out.
