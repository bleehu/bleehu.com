			<city> Dargeen </city>

		<baron> 
			<city> Baron </city>
			<description> Primarily a defensive outpost, this city is all about the military.  The surrounding farms grow enough to feed the soldiers, the mines get enough metal to arm the soldiers, and almost everything sold in town is equipment for the soldiers. </description>
