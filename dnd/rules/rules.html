		<div class="rule" id="grab">
			<h3>Grab</h3>
			<p>By using the grab power, any creature can try to seize a target bodily and keep it from moving. 
				Although class powers and monster powers are usually more effective than grab at locking a target 
				down, the advantage of grab is that anyone can use it, regardless of class.</p>
			<h4>GRAB: STANDARD ACTION</h4>
			<p>Target: You can attempt to grab a creature that is smaller than you, the same size category as you, or
				one category larger than you. The creature must be within your melee reach (don’t count extra reach
				from a weapon).</p>
			<p>Strength Attack: Make a Strength attack vs. Reflex. Do not add any weapon modifiers. 
				You must have at least one hand free to make a grab attempt. Hit: The enemy is immobilized 
				until it escapes or you end the grab. Your enemy can attempt to escape on its turn.</p>
			<p>Sustaining a Grab: You sustain a grab as a minor action. You can end a grab as a free action.</p>
			<p>Effects that End a Grab: If you are affected by a condition that prevents you from taking 
				opportunity actions (such as dazed, stunned, surprised, or unconscious), you immediately let go of a 
				grabbed enemy. If you move away from the creature you’re grabbing, you let go and the grab ends. 
				If a pull, a push, or a slide moves you or the creature you’re grabbing out of your reach, 
				the grab ends.</p>
			<p>A creature can try to move a target it is grabbing, whether or not it used the grab power to grab the target.</p>
			<h3>Move a Grabbed Target</h3>
			<h4>Action: Standard action.</h4>
			<p>Strength Check: The creature makes a Strength check opposed by the Fortitude of a target it is grabbing. 
				The check automatically succeeds if the target is a helpless ally of the creature.</p>
			<p>Success: The creature can move up to half its speed and pull the target with it. The creature’s 
				movement doesn’t provoke an opportunity attack from the grabbed target, but the movement otherwise 
				provokes opportunity attacks as normal.</p>
			<h3>Escape a grab</h3>
			<h4>Action: Move action.</h4>
			<p>You make can make an Acrobatics check vs. grabbing enemy’s Reflex or 
				an Athletics check vs. grabbing enemy’s Fortitude. If you succeed, 
				you escape the grab and can shift 1 square.</p>
			<p>A grab also ends if the creature grabbing you is affected by a 
				condition that prevents it from taking opportunity actions 
				(such as dazed, stunned, surprised, or unconscious). If the grabber 
				moves away from the you without dragging, it lets go and the grab 
				ends. If a pull, a push, or a slide moves you or the creature that 
				is grabbing you so that it is no longer adjacent to you, the grab 
				also ends.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="rule" id="flying">
		<h3>Flying</h3>
		<p>Some creatures have the innate ability to fly, whereas others gain the ability through powers, magic items, 
		or other attributes. The rules for flight emphasize abstraction and simplicity over simulation. In real life, a 
		flying creature’s ability to turn, the speed it must maintain to stay aloft, and other factors put a strict limit 
		on flight. In the game, flying creatures face far fewer limitations.
		Flight follows the basic movement rules, with the following clarifications. </p>
		<p>Fly Speed: To fly, a creature takes the walk, run, or charge action but uses its fly speed in place of its 
		walking speed. A creature that has a fly speed can also shift and take other move actions, as appropriate, 
		while flying.</p>
		<p>Moving Up and Down: While flying, a creature can move straight up, straight down, or diagonally up or down.
		There is no additional cost for moving up or down.</p>
		<p>Falling Prone: If a creature is knocked prone while it is flying, it falls. This means a flying creature 
		falls when it becomes unconscious or is subject to any other effect that knocks it prone. The creature isn’t 
		actually prone until it lands and takes falling damage.</p>
		<p>Remaining in the Air: A flying creature does not need to take any particular action to remain aloft; the 
		creature is assumed to be flying as it fights, moves, and takes other actions. However, a flying creature 
		falls the instant it is stunned, unless it can hover (see "Flight Traits").</p>
		<p>Landing: If a creature flies to a surface it can hold onto or rest on, the creature can land safely.</p>
		<p>Terrain: Terrain on the ground does not affect a flying creature if the terrain isn’t tall enough to reach
		it. Because of this rule, flying creatures can easily bypass typical difficult terrain, such as a patch of 
		ice on the ground. Aerial terrain (see below) can affect flying creatures.</p>
		<h4>Flight Traits</h4>
		<p>Many flying creatures have traits related to flight, which are noted in a creature’s stat block.</p>
		<p>Altitude Limit: If a creature has a specified altitude limit, the creature falls at the end of its 
		turn if it is flying higher than that limit. For example, a creature that has an altitude limit of 2 falls 
		at the end of its turn if it is flying higher than 2 squares.</p>
		<p>Hover: A creature that can hover, such as a beholder, can remain in the air even when it is stunned.</p>
		<h4>Aerial Terrain</h4>
		<p>Difficult terrain for a flying creature includes airborne debris, swirling winds, and other factors 
		that interfere with flight, including surface features that reach to a great height. Clouds provide 
		concealment, while towers, floating castles, and other structures provide cover. Strong gusts of wind 
		work like currents in water, following the rules under “Current".</p>
		</div>
		<div class="rule" id="fmove">
			<h3>Forced Movement</h3>
			<p>Certain powers and effects allow a creature to move a target forcibly, whether the target is willing or 
				unwilling. (Other effects, such as traps or zones, can also force targets to move.) The three kinds of 
				forced movement are pull, push, and slide. Teleporting a creature does not count as forced movement for 
				the purpose of these rules.</p>
			<ul>
			 <li>Pull: Pulling a target means that each square of the forced movement must bring the target closer to 
				the creature or effect that is pulling it.</li>
			 <li>Push: Pushing a target means that each square of the forced movement must move the target farther away 
				from the creature or effect that is pushing it.</li>
			 <li>Slide: Sliding a target can move it in any direction. Sometimes a creature can swap places with a 
				target. Doing so is a special kind of slide; the creature slides the target into its space and then 
				shifts so that its space includes at least 1 square that the target just left.</li>
			 </ul>
			<p>The following rules govern all three kinds of forced movement. A particular instance of forced movement 
				might contain exceptions to these rules.</p>
			<p>Distance, Specific Destination, or Both: The power or other effect that produces forced movement specifies 
				a distance in squares, a specified destination square, or both for the movement.
				When a distance is specified, it is a maximum; the creature or effect producing the forced movement can 
				move its target up to that number of squares (or none at all). For instance, a character’s power might 
				say, “You slide the target 4 squares (or “up to 4 squares”); both mean the character can move the target 
				up to 4 squares or not move it at all.
				When a destination is specified, it is absolute; the creature or effect must either move the target to 
				that destination or not move it at all. Often a destination is combined with a distance, which means the 
				target can be moved to the destination only if it is no farther away than the specified distance. For 
				instance, a character’s power might say, “You slide the target up to 5 squares to a square adjacent to 
				you (or “5 squares to a square adjacent to you),” both of which mean the character can move the target 
				up to 5 squares but only if the move ends in a square adjacent to that character.</p>
			<p>Line of Effect: A creature must have line of effect to any square that it pulls, pushes, or slides a 
				target into. Also, a target cannot be forced through blocking terrain.</p>
			<div class="houseRule">
				<img src="../images/house.png" />
				<h4> House Rule: </h4>
				<p> Targets pushed into blocking terrain take 1d10 per square pushed into blocking terrain.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Ignores Difficult Terrain: Forced movement isn’t hindered by difficult terrain.</p>
			<p>Ignores Speed: A target’s speed is irrelevant to the distance it is forced to move, and the target 
				expends none of its own actions for the movement.</p>
			<p>Destination Space: The destination of the forced movement must be an unoccupied space that is at least 
				the same size as the target. For instance, a Large creature cannot be pushed into a space that is only 1
				square wide.</p>
			<p>No Opportunity Actions Triggered: When a target is pulled, pushed, or slid, it does not trigger 
				opportunity actions, such as opportunity attacks, that are triggered by movement.</p>
			<p>Catching Oneself: If a target is forced over a precipice or into hindering terrain, such as lava or a 
				pit, the target can immediately make a saving throw to avoid going over the edge or entering that 
				terrain. If the creature saves, it falls prone in the last square it occupied before it would have 
				fallen or entered the terrain. Otherwise, it falls over the edge or enters the terrain. Once the saving 
				throw is resolved, the forced movement ends.</p>
			<p>Two-Dimensional: Forced movement is normally two-dimensional; all the squares of the movement must be on 
				the same horizontal plane. Forced movement can become three-dimensional when the target is flying, 
				is moved through a substance such as water, or is on a non-horizontal surface, such as an incline, 
				that supports it. This means an earthbound target cannot normally be pushed to a square in the air, but a 
				hovering target can be. Similarly, a target can be pulled down a flight of stairs, and it can be slid in
				any direction underwater.</p>
			<div class="houseRule">
				<img src="../images/house.png" />
				<h4> House Rule: </h4>
				<p> Targets can be slid up or down at any time.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Immobilized or Restrained: Being immobilized doesn’t prevent a target from being pulled, pushed, or slid,
				but being restrained does. See “Conditions" for more.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="rule" id="rest">
			<h3 id="sRest">Short Rest</h3>
			<p>A short rest allows a creature to regain the use of encounter powers and spend healing surges to 
				regain hit points. Short rests follow these rules.</p>
			<p>Duration: A short rest is about 5 minutes long.</p>
			<p>No Limit per Day: A creature can take an unlimited number of short rests per day.</p>
			<p>No Strenuous Activity: Resting means just that. The creature can stand guard, sit in place, 
				ride on a wagon or other vehicle, or do other tasks that don’t require much exertion.</p>
			<p>Regain the Use of Powers: After a short rest, a creature regains the use of expended 
				encounter powers.</p>
			<p>Spend Healing Surges: After a short rest, a creature can spend as many healing surges as desired
				(see “Hit Points and Healing,” page 255). A creature that runs out of healing surges must take an 
				extended rest to regain them.</p>
			<p>Using Powers during the Rest: If a creature uses an encounter power (such as a healing power) during 
				a short rest, it needs another short rest to regain the use of that power.</p>
			<p>Interruptions: If a creature’s short rest is interrupted, the creature needs to rest for another
				5 minutes to get the benefits of a short rest.</p>
			<p><a href="#contents"> Back to top </a></p>
			<h3 id="eRest">Extended Rest</h3>
			<p>Duration: An extended rest is at least 6 hours long.</p>
			<p>Once per Day: After a creature finishes an extended rest, it has to wait 12 hours before 
				beginning another one.</p>
			<p>No Strenuous Activity: A creature normally sleeps during an extended rest but doesn’t have to. 
				The creature can engage in light activity that doesn’t require much exertion.</p>
			<p>Regain Hit Points and Healing Surges: At the end of an extended rest, a creature regains all lost 
				hit points and all spent healing surges.</p>
			<p>Regain the Use of Powers: At the end of an extended rest, a creature regains the use of expended 
				encounter powers and daily powers.</p>
			<p>Action Points: At the end of an extended rest, a creature loses any unspent action points, but starts 
				fresh with 1 action point.</p>
			<p>Interruptions: If anything interrupts a creature’s extended rest, such as an attack, add the time 
				spent dealing with the interruption to the total time the creature needs to spend in the extended 
				rest.</p>
			<p><a href="#contents"> Back to top </a></p>
		</div>
		<div class="rule" id="ongoing">
			<h3>Ongoing Damage</h3>
			<p>Some powers deal damage on consecutive turns after the initial attack. 
				Such damage is called ongoing damage. An efreet might hit a creature 
				with a burst of fire that sets it alight, dealing ongoing fire damage. 
				When a snake’s venom courses through a creature’s blood, it deals 
				ongoing poison damage. A royal mummy’s plague chant deals ongoing 
				necrotic damage.</p>
			<p>Start of a Creature’s Turn: When a creature is subjected to ongoing 
				damage, it does not take the damage right away. Instead, the creature 
				takes the specified damage at the start of each of its turns until the 
				ongoing damage ends. For instance, a creature that is subjected to 
				ongoing 5 fire damage takes 5 fire damage at the start of each of its 
				turns.</p>
			<p>Save Ends: Unless otherwise noted, an instance of ongoing damage lasts 
				on a creature until the creature makes a successful saving throw 
				against it. See “Saving Throws". </p>
			<p>Different Types of Ongoing Damage: If a creature is subjected to ongoing 
				damage of different types (including no type) at the same time, it 
				takes damage of each of those types every round, and it must make a 
				separate saving throw against each damage type.</p>
			<p>Example: If a creature is taking ongoing 5 damage (which has no type) 
				when a power causes it to take ongoing 5 lightning damage, it is now 
				taking ongoing 5 damage and ongoing 5 lightning damage, and it must 
				make saving throws against each effect.</p>
			<p>Same Type of Ongoing Damage: If a creature is subject to multiple 
				instances of ongoing damage of the same type at the same time 
				(including no type), only the highest number applies.</p>
			<p>Example: If a creature is taking ongoing 5 damage (which has no type) 
				when a power causes it to take ongoing 10 damage, the creature is now 
				taking ongoing 10 damage, not 15.</p>
			<p><a href="#contents"> Back to top </a></p>
		</div>
		<div class="rule" id="surprise">
			<h3>Surprise Round</h3>
			<p>Some combat encounters begin with a surprise round, which occurs if 
				any creatures are caught completely off guard at the start of 
				battle. If even one creature is surprised, a surprise round occurs, 
				and all creatures that aren’t surprised act in initiative order 
				during that round. Surprised creatures can’t act at all during the 
				surprise round.</p>
			<p>Special Rules Two special rules apply to the surprise round.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Limited Action: If a creature is not surprised, it can take 
					only one of the following actions on its turn during the 
					surprise round: a standard action, a move action, or a minor 
					action. The creature can also take free actions, but it cannot 
					spend an action point. During the surprise round (but not on its
					turn), the creature can take an immediate action, as well as 
					opportunity actions. See “Action Types” for definitions of these
					terms. After every creature that is not surprised has acted, 
					the surprise round ends, and creatures can act normally in 
					subsequent rounds.</li>
				<li>Surprised: If a creature is surprised, it can’t take any actions,
					not even free actions, during the surprise round. The creature 
					also grants combat advantage. As soon as the surprise round ends,
					the creature is no longer surprised. Surprised is one of many 
					conditions that can be applied to a creature. See 
					<a href="#surprised" title="Surprised">“Conditions”.</a></li>
			</ul>

		<div class="rule" id="mile">
			<h3>Milestones and Quests</h3>
			<p>As adventurers move from one encounter to another on their way to gaining the next level, they reach milestones and complete quests.</p>
			<p><strong>Milestones:</strong> When the adventurers complete two consecutive encounters without 
				stopping for an <em>extended</em> rest, they reach a milestone. Each time they reach a 
				milestone, each adventurer gains an action point. The DM might provide additional
				rewards, depending on the adventure and the style of the campaign.</p>
			<p><strong>Quests:</strong> Quests are the fundamental story framework of an adventure—the reason the 
				adventurers want to get involved. They are why an adventure exists, and they indicate
				what the adventurers need to do to resolve the situation the adventure presents.</p>
			<p>A quest connects a series of encounters into a meaningful story. The simplest 
				adventures revolve around a single major quest, usually one that gives everyone in 
				the group a motivation to pursue it. For example, a group’s major quest might be to 
				put an end to the goblin raids on a local village, to rescue a kidnapped merchant, 
				or to recover an ancient relic lost in the nearby ruins.</p>
			<p>Most adventures, however, involve multiple quests. An adventure might have two or 
				more major quests. For example, the goblin raiders might also be responsible for 
				kidnapping an important merchant. Adventures often also include minor quests that 
				relate to individual characters’ goals or backgrounds. Sometimes these quests can 
				conflict with each other, presenting characters with interesting choices about which 
				quests to pursue.</p>
			<p>When the group completes a quest, each character earns experience points and 
				possibly other kinds of rewards, depending on the quest.</p>
