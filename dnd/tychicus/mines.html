		<h1> Northern Mines </h1>
		<h3> A small town in Northern Tychicus </h3>

			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<div>
				<p>The small mining town north of the enchanted forrest is serviced by
					a mining road built by Kriv, and sports a state-of-the-art crane,
					but mostly lacks the number of workers necissary to make it a real
					economic power for now. It does however produce enough material to
					supply domestic research, such as bomb research at the dojo in 
					<a href="mtebal.html" title="to Mt. Ebal">Mt. Ebal</a> or siege research
					in <a href="kedesh.html" title="to the city of Kedesh">Kedesh</a>.
					For quite some time, the northern mines where the only source of
					metal for <a href="tychicus.html" title="Back to Country view"> Tychicus,
					</a> but since the annex of <a href="cassalua.html" title="To
					Cassalua">Cassalua,</a> it now services mostly the eastern cities.</p>
