			<h3>Early History</h3>
			<div id="history">
			<p>Before Tychicus was formed, many people were displaced as refugees of the Great 
				War. These people settled in a destitute refugee camp over the future site of 
				Ramoth City. Along with these refugees came a small number of peace-seeking 
				fighters who escorted them on their journey.</p>
			<p>The prominent band of fighters really first came together to rescue a man who was
				noted for his verbal eccentricity, but written wisdom, from marauding goblins 
				who felt that the the otherwise unclaimed territory was theirs. It was during 
				this breif skirmish that the fighters found unity and group cohesion, as well 
				as one of the core principles of stealth.</p>
			<p>Soon after the camp grew into a settlement large enough both to feed and shelter 
				the refugees who were there, and to attract the attention of bandits who 
				planned to raze the towns in the area for plunder. In a history-defining move,
				the band united the nearby towns in the effort to preserve peace in the area. 
				These unified towns and tribes would later become the Tychicus of today. While
				Komoto shrewdly negotiated the support and deployment of troops to the town 
				under attack, Kriv courageously led the rest of the band in an assassination 
				of the Bandit's Chieftain. The companions were wildly successful on both 
				prongs of the attack, and their success led to a more prosperous region.</p>
			<p>When zombies from the local graveyard arose to terrify the town, the band 
				brutally returned the dead to the afterlife. They soon tracked down the 
				necromancer responsible with the help of Shadow, the talented hobbit. With a 
				split vote, the band decided to honor their God by sparing the life of the 
				Necromancer with a desperate plea to their God to prevent the summoning of 
				Orcus himself. The Necromancer lost all of her memories and was pardoned for 
				her sins and allowed to live in the now budding town of Ramoth.</p>
			<p>When sightings of Fey creatures in the area surrounding the towns provoked 
				distress in their home town's mayor, The band eventually found their way to a 
				stolen amulet and Feybreach Castle. They cunningly deceived the monsters there 
				into turning on each other, after which they subdued the Fey portal there with 
				little difficulty.</p>
			<p>When word of a deadly assault from the Great War reached the band, they 
				immediately sprang into action. While Komoto began the diplomacy that founded 
				the country of Tychicus, the band's rogues began a massively successful sabotage
				campaign that delayed arrival of the attackers by near a month. A month in which
				Kriv and his sister Aroari used to build stalwart timber walls and Shadow used 
				to construct devastating elemental defenses around the country's entire border. 
				Athena helped as well by adding firetraps to the border before the fight. After
				some fierce fighting on the border, the attackers fell back, relenting to find 
				easier prey.</p>
